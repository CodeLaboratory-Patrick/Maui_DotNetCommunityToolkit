## 1. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
The **MVVM** tools provided by the .NET Community Toolkit make implementing the MVVM design pattern easier by reducing boilerplate code, simplifying data binding, and improving the structure of UI applications.

### Key Features
- **ObservableObject**: Base class to create properties that notify changes, simplifying property updates.
- **RelayCommand**: Simplifies command binding between UI and business logic.
- **Attributes** like `[ObservableProperty]` that automatically generate properties with change notifications.

### Example: Creating an MVVM Property
The following example demonstrates how to create a view model with an observable property and a command.

```csharp
using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.ComponentModel;
using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.Input;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public partial class SampleViewModel : ObservableObject
{
    [ObservableProperty]
    private string greeting;

    public SampleViewModel()
    {
        Greeting = "Welcome to .NET Community Toolkit!";
    }

    [ICommand]
    public async Task UpdateGreetingAsync()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        Greeting = "Hello, world!";
    }
}
```
- **`[ObservableProperty]`**: Generates the `Greeting` property and notifies changes when its value is updated.
- **`[ICommand]`**: Generates the `UpdateGreetingAsync` command, which can be easily bound to a button in the UI.

### When to Use MVVM in .NET Community Toolkit?

- **Trace Helpers**: Provides enhanced logging and diagnostic utilities to track application execution.

### Example: Using WeakReference for Memory Management
The following example demonstrates how a `WeakReference` can be used to ensure an object is not preventing garbage collection.

```csharp
public class MemoryDemo
{
    private WeakReference<DataObject> _dataReference;

    public void CreateData()
    {
        var data = new DataObject();
        _dataReference = new WeakReference<DataObject>(data);
    }

    public bool IsDataAlive()
    {
        return _dataReference.TryGetTarget(out _);
    }
}
```
- **WeakReference**: Allows `DataObject` to be garbage-collected if no other references exist, reducing memory usage.

### When to Use Diagnostics Tools in .NET Community Toolkit?
- Tracking down memory leaks or optimizing memory usage.
- Improving debugging by adding detailed trace logs.
- Analyzing object lifetime in complex applications to ensure efficient resource utilization.

## 3. High Performance
The **High Performance** components provide highly optimized collections and data structures that can help achieve greater performance, particularly when dealing with large volumes of data or requiring high-throughput operations.

### Key Features
- **High-Performance Collections**: Collections like `ObservableCollection` optimized for large datasets.
- **MemoryMarshal and Span**: APIs for managing and manipulating memory in a highly efficient way.

### Example: Using `ObservableCollection`
An `ObservableCollection` is often used to provide data-binding support to UI components while also offering better performance.

```csharp
using CommunityToolkit.HighPerformance.Helpers;
using System.Collections.ObjectModel;

public class ProductCatalog
{
    public ObservableCollection<Product> Products { get; set; }

    public ProductCatalog()
    {
        Products = new ObservableCollection<Product>
        {
            new Product { Name = "Laptop", Price = 1200 },
            new Product { Name = "Mouse", Price = 20 },
            new Product { Name = "Keyboard", Price = 50 }
        };
    }
}

public class Product
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```
- **`ObservableCollection`**: Provides automatic notifications when items are added, removed, or refreshed, which makes it ideal for data-bound UI scenarios.

### When to Use High Performance Tools in .NET Community Toolkit?

# MVVM Toolkit - ObservableObject

The **MVVM Toolkit** is a part of the .NET Community Toolkit, specifically designed to simplify the implementation of the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** design pattern in .NET applications. One of the key components of this toolkit is the **`ObservableObject`** class. `ObservableObject` provides a base implementation that significantly reduces boilerplate code required for implementing data-binding properties, making it easier to develop reactive user interfaces.

In this guide, we will discuss what `ObservableObject` is, its features, how it can be used with detailed examples, and when it should be applied in your projects.

## What is `ObservableObject`?

**`ObservableObject`** is a base class provided by the **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.ComponentModel** namespace. It is used as part of the MVVM design pattern to implement properties that notify the view when their values change. `ObservableObject` implements the **INotifyPropertyChanged** interface, which is essential for data binding in MVVM, as it allows UI elements to be updated when the underlying data changes.

### Key Features of `ObservableObject`

- **Implements INotifyPropertyChanged**: This interface allows properties in the view model to notify the UI when their values change.
- **Reduces Boilerplate Code**: The `ObservableObject` class, combined with attributes like `[ObservableProperty]`, eliminates the need to manually implement property change notifications.
- **Supports MVVM Pattern**: `ObservableObject` is specifically designed to work seamlessly with MVVM, which separates UI logic from business logic.

## Example: Creating an Observable Property
Below is an example of how to use `ObservableObject` to create a view model that notifies the UI whenever a property value changes.

### Step-by-Step Example
```csharp
using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.ComponentModel;
using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.Input;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public partial class UserProfileViewModel : ObservableObject
{
    [ObservableProperty]
    private string userName;

    [ObservableProperty]
    private int age;

    public UserProfileViewModel()
    {
        UserName = "John Doe";
        Age = 25;
    }

    [ICommand]
    public async Task UpdateUserNameAsync()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        UserName = "Jane Doe";
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **`ObservableObject` Base Class**: The `UserProfileViewModel` class inherits from `ObservableObject`, which provides the necessary infrastructure for notifying property changes.
- **`[ObservableProperty]` Attribute**: This attribute is used to define a property (`userName` and `age`). It automatically generates a public property and the logic for property change notifications. Instead of manually implementing getters, setters, and calling `OnPropertyChanged()`, you only need to declare the private field.
- **`[ICommand]` Attribute**: Generates a command from the `UpdateUserNameAsync` method, making it easy to bind to a button in the UI.

### Generated Code Equivalent
Using the `[ObservableProperty]` attribute eliminates the need to write the following boilerplate code for each property:

```csharp
private string userName;
public string UserName
{
    get => userName;
    set
    {
        if (userName != value)
        {
            userName = value;
            OnPropertyChanged();
        }
    }
}
```
This reduction in repetitive code makes it easier and quicker to develop view models.

## When to Use `ObservableObject`?

| Scenario                            | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Developing MVVM Applications**    | Use `ObservableObject` as the base class for view models to simplify data binding logic.     |
| **Eliminating Boilerplate Code**    | Use `[ObservableProperty]` to generate properties with change notifications automatically.   |
| **Building Reactive User Interfaces** | When your UI needs to react to changes in data, `ObservableObject` helps in implementing those bindings effectively. |

### Pros and Cons of Using `ObservableObject`

| Pros                                         | Cons                                                              |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reduces Code Complexity**: Eliminates repetitive boilerplate code. | **Limited Use Outside MVVM**: Primarily useful for MVVM patterns.  |
| **Simplifies Property Management**: Easy to define and manage properties. | **Requires Attribute Knowledge**: Developers need to learn specific attributes like `[ObservableProperty]`. |
| **Built-in Change Notification**: Implements `INotifyPropertyChanged` by default. | **Dependency**: Relies on `CommunityToolkit.Mvvm`, adding an external dependency. |
