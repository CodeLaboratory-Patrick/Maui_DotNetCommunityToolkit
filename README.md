## 1. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
The **MVVM** tools provided by the .NET Community Toolkit make implementing the MVVM design pattern easier by reducing boilerplate code, simplifying data binding, and improving the structure of UI applications.

### Key Features
- **ObservableObject**: Base class to create properties that notify changes, simplifying property updates.
- **RelayCommand**: Simplifies command binding between UI and business logic.
- **Attributes** like `[ObservableProperty]` that automatically generate properties with change notifications.

### Example: Creating an MVVM Property
The following example demonstrates how to create a view model with an observable property and a command.

```csharp
using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.ComponentModel;
using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.Input;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public partial class SampleViewModel : ObservableObject
{
    [ObservableProperty]
    private string greeting;

    public SampleViewModel()
    {
        Greeting = "Welcome to .NET Community Toolkit!";
    }

    [ICommand]
    public async Task UpdateGreetingAsync()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        Greeting = "Hello, world!";
    }
}
```
- **`[ObservableProperty]`**: Generates the `Greeting` property and notifies changes when its value is updated.
- **`[ICommand]`**: Generates the `UpdateGreetingAsync` command, which can be easily bound to a button in the UI.

### When to Use MVVM in .NET Community Toolkit?
- Building desktop (WPF, WinForms) or mobile (Xamarin, MAUI) applications.
- Ensuring a clear separation of concerns between UI and business logic.
- Simplifying data-binding and reducing the amount of boilerplate code.

## 2. Diagnostics
The **Diagnostics** component offers a set of debugging helpers to assist developers in diagnosing and resolving issues. This includes helpers for analyzing memory usage, tracing execution flow, and providing enhanced debugging insights.

### Key Features
- **WeakReferences**: Helps in reducing memory leaks by allowing developers to track object lifetimes.
- **Trace Helpers**: Provides enhanced logging and diagnostic utilities to track application execution.

### Example: Using WeakReference for Memory Management
The following example demonstrates how a `WeakReference` can be used to ensure an object is not preventing garbage collection.

```csharp
public class MemoryDemo
{
    private WeakReference<DataObject> _dataReference;

    public void CreateData()
    {
        var data = new DataObject();
        _dataReference = new WeakReference<DataObject>(data);
    }

    public bool IsDataAlive()
    {
        return _dataReference.TryGetTarget(out _);
    }
}
```
- **WeakReference**: Allows `DataObject` to be garbage-collected if no other references exist, reducing memory usage.

### When to Use Diagnostics Tools in .NET Community Toolkit?
- Tracking down memory leaks or optimizing memory usage.
- Improving debugging by adding detailed trace logs.
- Analyzing object lifetime in complex applications to ensure efficient resource utilization.

## 3. High Performance
The **High Performance** components provide highly optimized collections and data structures that can help achieve greater performance, particularly when dealing with large volumes of data or requiring high-throughput operations.

### Key Features
- **High-Performance Collections**: Collections like `ObservableCollection` optimized for large datasets.
- **MemoryMarshal and Span**: APIs for managing and manipulating memory in a highly efficient way.

### Example: Using `ObservableCollection`
An `ObservableCollection` is often used to provide data-binding support to UI components while also offering better performance.

```csharp
using CommunityToolkit.HighPerformance.Helpers;
using System.Collections.ObjectModel;

public class ProductCatalog
{
    public ObservableCollection<Product> Products { get; set; }

    public ProductCatalog()
    {
        Products = new ObservableCollection<Product>
        {
            new Product { Name = "Laptop", Price = 1200 },
            new Product { Name = "Mouse", Price = 20 },
            new Product { Name = "Keyboard", Price = 50 }
        };
    }
}

public class Product
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```
- **`ObservableCollection`**: Provides automatic notifications when items are added, removed, or refreshed, which makes it ideal for data-bound UI scenarios.

### When to Use High Performance Tools in .NET Community Toolkit?
- Handling large collections of data where performance is critical.
- Optimizing memory usage in resource-constrained environments.
